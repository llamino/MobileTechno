Overview
This Django project offers a robust user management system with essential features to ensure secure and efficient handling of user accounts. Key functionalities include user registration with email verification, JWT-based authentication for APIs, profile management, and password handling. The system leverages Django's powerful framework alongside Django REST Framework and SimpleJWT for seamless API interactions.

Features
User Registration with Email Verification: Ensures that users verify their email addresses before activating their accounts, enhancing security and authenticity.
JWT Authentication: Implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and scalable API authentication.
Profile Management: Allows users to view and edit their profiles, including personal information and profile pictures.
Password Management: Provides secure mechanisms for users to change their passwords while maintaining active sessions.
RESTful API Endpoints: Offers API endpoints for user registration, login, and token refresh, facilitating integration with frontend frameworks or third-party services.
Custom User Model: Extends Django's default user model to include additional fields and functionalities tailored to project requirements.
Responsive Templates: Delivers user-friendly interfaces for registration, login, profile viewing/editing, and password management.
Technologies Used
Django 4.x: The primary web framework for building the project.
Django REST Framework: Facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs.
Django REST Framework SimpleJWT: Manages JWT authentication for secure API access.
SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL: Database options for data storage.
Bootstrap (Optional): Enhances the styling and responsiveness of templates.
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Set up a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add the following configurations:

Secret Key: A unique key for your Django project.
Debug Mode: Set to True for development and False for production.
Allowed Hosts: Specify the hosts/domain names your Django site can serve.
Email Configuration: SMTP settings for sending verification emails.
JWT Configuration: Define token lifetimes and authentication parameters.
5. Apply Migrations
Set up the database by applying migrations:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
6. Create a Superuser
Create an administrative user to access the Django admin interface:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
7. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Access the application by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.

Key Components
accounts/: Handles user-related functionalities.

models.py: Defines the custom User and Profile models.
forms.py: Contains forms for registration, login, profile editing, and password changes.
views.py: Manages the logic for user registration, activation, authentication, and profile management.
serializers.py: Serializes user data for API endpoints.
urls.py: Maps URLs to the corresponding views.
templates/accounts/: Stores HTML templates for various user interfaces.
yourproject/: Core Django project settings.

settings.py: Configures project settings, including database, email, and JWT configurations.
urls.py: Routes URLs to the appropriate applications.
Usage
User Registration
Access Registration Page: Navigate to /register/.
Fill Out the Form: Enter your username, email, password, and other required information.
Submit Registration: Upon submission, an email with an activation link will be sent to your provided email address.
Activate Account: Click the activation link in the email to activate your account and automatically log in.
User Login
Access Login Page: Navigate to /login/.
Enter Credentials: Provide your username/email and password.
Authenticate: Upon successful login, JWT tokens are stored in cookies for authenticated API access.
Profile Management
View Profile: Navigate to /profile/ to view your profile details.
Edit Profile: Navigate to /profile/edit/ to update your personal information and profile picture.
Password Management
Change Password: Navigate to /change-password/ to securely change your password while maintaining your active session.
API Endpoints
Register: POST /api/register/ – Register a new user account.
Login: POST /api/login/ – Obtain JWT tokens for authentication.
Refresh Token: POST /api/token/refresh/ – Refresh your JWT access token.
Configuration
Email Settings
Ensure that your email settings are correctly configured to enable sending verification emails. This includes setting up the SMTP server details and authentication credentials in your environment variables or settings.py.

JWT Settings
Configure JWT settings in settings.py to define token lifetimes and other authentication parameters, ensuring secure and efficient token management.

Security Considerations
Environment Variables: Store sensitive information, such as SECRET_KEY and email credentials, in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your codebase.
HTTPS: Use HTTPS in production environments to secure data transmission between the client and server.
Token Expiry: Adjust JWT token lifetimes according to your security requirements to balance usability and protection.
Email Verification: Implement secure email verification processes to prevent unauthorized account activations.
Password Handling: Ensure passwords are hashed and managed securely to protect user data.
